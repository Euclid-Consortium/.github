# Euclid Consortium

## Welcome!

Welcome to the [Euclid Consortium](https://www.euclid-ec.org/) (EC) GitHub organization for open-source software development. Here, you will find a variety of tools developed with the EC, maintained on a best-effort basis. All tools are fully open-source, and we invite feedback and contributions from the wider community, provided that you adhere to the contribution guidelines in each repository and the [EC Code of Conduct](https://www.euclid-ec.org/consortium/diversity-and-conduct/) at all times.

## Acknowledgement

If you use any of these tools for academic purposes, we kindly request that you cite all references provided in the respective repository for any tools used (e.g., for analysis, comparison, or testing). This ensures fair recognition of the efforts of the developers, particularly early-career researchers who stand to benefit most.

## Troubleshooting 

If you encounter an issue with any of these tools, please open an issue in the corresponding repository. As mentioned, these tools are maintained on a best-effort basis, and we cannot guarantee long-term support or quick responses to your inquiries.

In the absence of a response, consider opening a [discussion thread](https://github.com/orgs/Euclid-Consortium/discussions) to seek support from other developers or the user community.

In any case, please ensure that you respect the [EC Code of Conduct](https://www.euclid-ec.org/consortium/diversity-and-conduct/) at all times.
